{\bfseries{cpp\+Fuzzer}} is a simple C++ fuzzer designed to help identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in software by generating and testing a wide range of input data. This tool can be used to improve the robustness and security of software applications by simulating real-\/world scenarios that could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or security breaches.\hypertarget{md_docs_2overview_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Purpose}{Purpose}}\label{md_docs_2overview_autotoc_md2}
The primary goals of {\bfseries{cpp\+Fuzzer}} are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Vulnerability Discovery\+:}} Discovering vulnerabilities, such as memory leaks, buffer overflows, and other software defects that may lead to security vulnerabilities.
\item {\bfseries{Stress Testing\+:}} Subjecting the target application to a high volume of random and unexpected inputs to identify potential stability issues or crashes.
\item {\bfseries{Test Coverage\+:}} Measuring the code coverage of the target application, helping developers identify untested or rarely executed code paths.
\item {\bfseries{Security Testing\+:}} Identifying security flaws and weaknesses in the software, helping developers proactively address security concerns.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_docs_2overview_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{How It Works}{How It Works}}\label{md_docs_2overview_autotoc_md3}
{\bfseries{cpp\+Fuzzer}} operates by generating a variety of input data and feeding it into the target software. It continuously monitors the behavior of the software, looking for anomalies, crashes, or unexpected results. The fuzzer then reports any issues found, enabling developers to investigate and address them.\hypertarget{md_docs_2overview_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Why We Need It}{Why We Need It}}\label{md_docs_2overview_autotoc_md4}
Software systems are complex, and it is challenging to anticipate all possible input scenarios. Traditional testing methods may overlook edge cases or security vulnerabilities. {\bfseries{cpp\+Fuzzer}} helps address these challenges by automating the process of generating diverse input data and systematically testing software for issues.

Whether you are developing a new application or maintaining an existing one, {\bfseries{cpp\+Fuzzer}} can be a valuable tool in your software development toolkit, helping you ensure your software is robust, reliable, and secure.
