# cppFuzzer

Welcome to the **cppFuzzer** project! This is a simple C++ fuzzer designed to help identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in software by generating and testing a wide range of input data.

## Overview

For a detailed overview of the project and its goals, please refer to [overview.md](https://github.com/mendax0110/cppFuzzer/blob/main/docs/overview.md).

## Purpose

The primary goals of **cppFuzzer** are:

- **Vulnerability Discovery:** Discovering vulnerabilities, such as memory leaks, buffer overflows, and other software defects that may lead to security vulnerabilities.

- **Stress Testing:** Subjecting the target application to a high volume of random and unexpected inputs to identify potential stability issues or crashes.

- **Test Coverage:** Measuring the code coverage of the target application, helping developers identify untested or rarely executed code paths.

- **Security Testing:** Identifying security flaws and weaknesses in the software, helping developers proactively address security concerns.

## How It Works

**cppFuzzer** operates by generating a variety of input data and feeding it into the target software. It continuously monitors the behavior of the software, looking for anomalies, crashes, or unexpected results. The fuzzer then reports any issues found, enabling developers to investigate and address them.

## Getting Started

To get started with **cppFuzzer**, please follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section of the [overview.md](https://github.com/mendax0110/cppFuzzer/blog/main/overview.md) file.
